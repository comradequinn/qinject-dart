  /// A `Factory Delegate` is a function that is invoked by the `TConsumer` itself
  /// to create the `TDependency` instance. Flutter widgets, for example, will
  /// typically be registered with a `Factory Delegate`.
  ///
  /// The [Resolver] delegate accepts a `TConsumer` argument which is set by

  /// it can be useful should the delegate be required to return different `TDependency`
  /// implementations for different `TConsumer`s.
  ///
  /// Dependencies can be registered in any order, regardless of whether they
  /// depend on each other. This due to the registrations being defined as delegates.
  /// These are not evaluated until `use<TConsumer, TDependency>` is invoked.

  /// which returns a new instance of `EventTimer` for every call to `use<TConsumer, EventTimer>`

  /// Qinject.register((_) => EventTimer());

  ///
  /// *Note that while the `Qinject.register` signature is `Qinject.register<TConsumer, TDependency>`
  /// the type arguments can be omitted due to Dart's type inference. They need only be specified
  /// explicitly if a type that is derived from the actual type being registered is being returned. Though, in
  /// such a case, casting the returned type in the function to the registered type may be preferable
  /// to specifying type arguments in terms of readability.*
  ///
  /// This next example registers a `Factory Delegate` for the `HelloWorldWidget` flutter widget
  /// constructor. It will be returned by calls to `use<TConsumer, HelloWorldWidget Function()>` and
  /// would then be invoked by the caller whenever it was required to render a HelloWorldWidget.
